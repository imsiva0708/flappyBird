## Introduction

FlappyBirdV2 is my take on the classic Flappy Bird game. This version aims to integrate deep learning reinforcement techniques to enhance the gameplay experience and provide a more challenging environment. The current version is just a manual play mode, but the model is coming soon.

## Features

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay
- Machine learning integration for smarter obstacles
- Improved graphics and animations
- Customizable game settings

## Installation

To get started with FlappyBirdV2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlappyBirdV2.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FlappyBirdV2
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:

```bash
python flappybird.py
```

## Future Plans

In future versions, FlappyBirdV2 will incorporate deep learning reinforcement models to further enhance the gameplay experience. The current version is designed for normal human playability.
